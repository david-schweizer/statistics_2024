## ***Course description***

The course will provide students with skills in quantitative methods for
investigating key political science topics and illustrate these methods
with practical examples. Participants will learn to carry out empirical
analyses independently using the statistical software R. No prior
knowledge of R is required. The main topics of the course are
univariate, bivariate and first multivariate analysis methods as well as
the graphical and tabular presentation of empirical results. Session
will consist of a mixture of instructor input, applied programming, and
discussion. Therefore, we will incorporate elements of the inverted
classroom. This requires participants to prepare materials for the
session and then apply them during the session.

## ***Prerequisites***

There are no prerequisites for this course, except the willingness to
familiarise yourself with the programming language R.
