## ***Course description***

The course will provide students with skills in quantitative methods for
investigating key political science topics and illustrate these methods
with practical examples. Participants will learn to carry out empirical
analyses independently using the statistical software R. No prior
knowledge of R is required. The main topics of the course are
univariate, bivariate and first multivariate analysis methods as well as
the graphical and tabular presentation of empirical results. Session
will consist of a mixture of instructor input, applied programming, and
discussion. Therefore, we will incorporate elements of the inverted
classroom. This requires participants to prepare materials for the
session and then apply them during the session.

## ***Prerequisites***

There are no prerequisites for this course, except the willingness to
familiarise yourself with the programming language R.

## ***Course requirements***

-   *Active preparation and participation* during sessions

-   *2 (smaller)* *assignments* during the semester (20% of your grade)

    -   From 20.03.24 11:15 until 08.04.24 18:00

    -   From 17.04.24 11:15 until 22.04.24 18:00

## Final project

***In a nutshell: Ask a question youâ€™re curious about, collect relevant
data and visualize them with regard to your question.***

Instead of a typical term paper, the project for this class will consist
of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing (*OPTION A*) or you can
conduct a more guided data analysis (*OPTION B*). Again, in this final
assignment, you need to demonstrate you understanding of the
concepts/code covered during the semester. In short, project should
include the following:

-   Data import

-   Tidy and transform the data

-   Answering the research question with descriptives (this includes
    visualizations) and investigate the question using linear or
    logistic regression

-   Present your analysis in a quarto document.

#### **In more detail:**

There are two options. In any case, I recommend to **discuss your
approach and ideas either via e-mail or during office hours!**

***OPTION A: Your own project***

You can choose the data based on your own interest. The goal of this
project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have
covered in this seminar (and beyond, if you like) and apply them in a
meaningful way.

The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis/visualization, i.e.,
do not calculate every statistic, visualize the same data with lots of
different graphs, but rather let me know that you are proficient at
asking a meaningful question and providing answers to this question;
that you are proficient in using R, and that you work in a reproducible
way.

Therefore, the project is very open ended. There is no limit on what
tools or packages you may use but sticking to packages we learned in
class is recommended. But also keep in mind that you do not need to
visualize all of the data at once. For example, a single high-quality
visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of
poor-quality visualizations.

The scope of your project should be comparable to *OPTION B*. Again,
please discuss your idea and outline with me via e-mail or during office
hours.

***OPTION B: European Social Survey & (Perception of) democracy***

Alternatively, you can work on a guided project. Some of the main steps
in the workflow are roughly defined (i.e., research question and data),
still you need to make your own decisions when it comes to presenting
and analyzing the data. Here, we would be interested in the influence of
a perceived democratic deficit and satisfaction with democracy. We can
investigate this using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) -
Round 10.

Our expectation would be that a higher perceived democratic deficit is
associated with a lower satisfaction with democracy. In addition, we can
think of various factors with the potential to affect both the perceived
democratic deficit and satisfaction with democracy (possible omitted
variable bias!): efficacy that is the belief that one can participate in
politics and/or has the possibility to influence politics. Further,
trust in political actors and/or institutions might confound the
relationship we are interested in. Please inspect the documentation
(e.g., source questionnaire) of ESS round 10, this is necessary to
identify the relevant variables.

Hence, this project would include the following:

**Importing data**

You can get the data using the [ESS Datafile
Builder](https://ess.sikt.no/en/data-builder/?tab=round_country). Select
all countries from round 10 (also 10SC - self-completion) and download
all variables.

**Data transformation**

-   Our first goal is to create a variable called "democratic_deficit"
    that is the difference between the perceived state of democracy and
    the respondents' opinion how democracy should look like. To do so,
    we need to determine first what variables we want to use to measure
    respondents' view of democracy. In this project, we want to focus on
    the statements that national elections are free and fair, that the
    media are free to criticise the government, that the rights of
    minority groups are protected, and the courts treat everyone the
    same. Let's create our variables regarding the perceived state of
    democracy and the respondents' opinion how democracy should look
    like by calculating the mean to the aforementioned statements:

    -   Identify the relevant variables

    -   Drop values from the data set that indicate that respondent's
        "Don't know" or "Refuse" to answer the question.

    -   Calculate the means. *Hint: Think about how to deal with missing
        values.* Now you can create the democratic deficit variable.

-   Further, identify the possible confounding variables as well as the
    dependent variable.

    -   Again, keep in mind to drop "Don't know" or "Refuse" from the
        dataset.

    -   Then, for the variables related to efficacy, we are

        -   1\) interested in a battery of items asking respondents if
            they have done a list of things that might improve things in
            their country or prevent things from going wrong. The first
            item in this battery asks respondents' if they have
            contacted a politician, government or local government
            official in the last 12 months. These eight questions are
            binary: Respondents can answer "Yes" or "no". Based on these
            questions, calculate an additive index ranging from 0 to 8.
            A respondent should get the value 8 if he or she answered
            each question with "Yes".

        -   2\) interested in the question how much respondents would
            you say that the political system in their country allows
            people like themselves to have an influence on politics.

    -   For trust in political actors and/or institutions, we want to to
        focus on the trust in their countries parliament (feel free to
        choose another actor/institution or calculate an average for
        multiple actors/institutions).

    -   Finally, for the dependent variable, select the question that
        asks respondents "And on the whole, how satisfied are you with
        the way democracy works in \[country\]?

-   Now, just *select* the relevant variables (drop the other variables)
    and filter the dataset so that you only keep respondents from
    Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.

**Descriptives & Visualization**

-   Create a table with summary statistics for all remaining variables
    (minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation). Do this separately for
    respondents from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.

-   Produce two plots differentiating by country: 1) show the
    distribution of the dependent variable, and 2) show the distribution
    of the main independent variable, i.e., the perceived democratic
    deficit.

-   Describe the plots. Can you detect any descriptive evidence for our
    research question?

-   Produce a plot that highlights the relationship between the
    dependent and main independent variable.

**Inference & Visualization**

-   Let's start by focusing on the case of Austria only. Run a bivariate
    regression with satisfaction with democracy as dependent variable
    and the perceived democratic deficit as independent variable. Is a
    OLS regression or a logit regression the better approach? Report the
    results in a table. Interpret the regression coefficient
    (statistical significance, direction, and effect size).

-   Let's add the possible confounding variables to the regression
    model. Estimate separate, bivariate models for each confounding
    variable. Finally estimate a multivariate regression that includes
    all confounding variables at once. Report the results of these
    regression models in *one* table. Interpret the coefficients.

-   Based on the multivariate regression, create a coefficient plot.

-   Finally, let's have a look at all three countries. However, include
    the country variable as a factor variable in the regression. Report
    the results in a table. Interpret the country coefficients.

**Reporting with a Quarto document**

Put it all together in one quarto document:

-   Give it a suitable title, include your name, and the date of
    submission.

-   Show both the code as well as the output of the code in the
    document. However, hide messages and warnings.

-   Structure the document with headings.

-   Remember our session on data visualization. Your graphs and figures
    should have informative captions, axes labels, a theme, etc.

#### **Grading of the project will take into account the following:**

-   Correctness - Are data import, transformation, and statistical
    procedures carried out and explained correctly?

-   Writing  - What is the quality of the statistical/descriptive
    presentation, writing, and explanations? You should write a few
    sentences for each task, explaining your steps and thinking. Give an
    interpretation if asked for.

-   Reproducibility: Can the quarto document and possibly other scripts
    for data pre-processing be executed on another device without error?
    Annotate your code extensively (Describe the steps you are doing).

-   *BONUS: Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully
    thought out? How well is the project documented? Does it appear that
    time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the
    project? (More BONUS points possible for Option A)*

**A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:**

-   *1,0: Outstanding effort.*Â Student understands how to apply all
    statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument,
    can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate
    the results to others.

-   *1,3 - 2,0: Good effort.* Student understands most of the concepts,
    puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of
    their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.

-   *2,3 - 3,0: Good/Passing effort.* Student has misunderstanding of
    concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together
    in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes
    unclear.

-   *3,3 - 4,0: Struggling effort.* Student is making some effort, but
    has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together
    a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.

-   *Fail*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.
