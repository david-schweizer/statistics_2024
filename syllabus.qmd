## **Course description**

Using a mix of lecture-style input, interactive teaching, and
discussions, this course teaches the fundamentals of scientific work and
good scientific practice in the subject of political science using
practical examples. Topics include critical reading of scientific texts,
literature review and reference management software, formulating
testable hypotheses, types of data collection and analysis, presenting
empirical results, and how to write term papers. Overall, students will
be equipped to critically evaluate research and conduct their own
research projects with a focus on quantitative methods.

## **Learning outcome**

Students learn the most important qualitative and quantitative methods
for data collection and data analysis. They are able to interpret and
critically evaluate existing empirical studies. Students learn to
independently formulate a research question, collect data, and analyze
data.

## **Prerequisites**

There are no prerequisites for this course, except the willingness to
familiarise yourself with the programming language R.

## **Course requirements**

**Active participation**

-   Critically engaging with the assigned readings for each session. Use
    Slack to post any questions or discuss with your peers if you do not
    understand concepts. Usually, I post questions to think about
    regarding the readings. Keep them in mind while reading.

-   Working on little assignments throughout the semester (e.g., think
    of a research question, conduct a literature search)

-   Actively participating in discussions and group work during our
    weekly meetings

### Group presentations

::: panel-tabset
## In general

-   4 groups, 10-12 minutes of presentation, 15 minutes of discussion

-   Prepare a powerpoint presentation. Send me at least an outline until
    **November 27, 11:30 am.**

-   Participate in discussion of other presentations

-   Topics can include: Democratic backsliding, the political impact of
    radical right populist parties, cleavage politics (e.g., young vs.
    old, rural vs. urban, ...)

## Expectations

    -   (Simple data analysis)

-   [Deadline:]{.underline} 31.01.2024, 23:59.

## **Organization & Learning Resources**

**Course website, Slack, and OLAT:**

The plan is to use primarily the course website and Slack for providing
the structure of the seminar and communication, respectively.
Nevertheless, you will also receive mails via OLAT. Make sure to
regularly check your university e-mail address.

-   You can find the course website here:

-   If you have contacted me with a question via any channel and you did
    not hear back after 2 days (except over the weekend), please just
    send me your question again!

**Office hours:**

-   Via Zoom, Wednesday 11:15 -- 12:15, please make an appointment by
    e-mail beforehand

-   If you have a specific question or problem (e.g., finding a research
    question), please tell me before coming to the office hours (when
    making the appointment). This way , I can also prepare for it and
    thereby making our meeting more productive and constructive.

**Students with disabilities or chronic illnesses:**

-   Please contact me or the Office of Student Affairs if you need
    special assistance due to disabilities or chronic illnesses.

-   And please do this early in the semester so that we can make the
    appropriate arrangements immediately.

**If you need any support or face difficult situations:**

Of course, you can always talk directly to me if you feel comfortable
with the question. It is important to note that the [University's Office
for Equality and Gender
Studies](https://www.uibk.ac.at/gleichbehandlung/belaestigung/ansprechpersonen.html)
supports and advises you in cases of discrimination or sexual
harassment. Further, you can rely on the [psychological
counseling](https://www.studierendenberatung.at/en) offered by the
university.

## **Readings**

The primary readings for this seminar are chapters from the following
books:

-   Kellstedt, P. M., & Whitten, G. D. (2018). *The fundamentals of
    political science research*. Cambridge University Press.

-   King, G., Keohane, R. O., & Verba, S. (1994). *Designing social
