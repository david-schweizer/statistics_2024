The main topics of the course are univariate, bivariate and first multivariate analysis methods as well as the graphical and tabular presentation of empirical results. Session will consist of a mixture of instructor input, applied programming, and discussion. Therefore, we will incorporate elements of the inverted classroom.

The workflow is exactly the same as for the 2021 data! So you can just adapt the code from above.\nYOUR TURN!\nYou can add your code to the code chunks below. If you struggle you can have a look at the end of this document. There, you can find helpful code.\nFirst, we need to load the data:\nNext, we need to transform the data again: 1) we want to get rid of all rows regarding the federal and regional level, and keep the constituency level, 2) we are only interested in the “Zweitstimme”, 3) then, select only party name, vote share, and constituency_number, 4) we are only interested in the vote share of the AfD.\nHere, we load the 2017 structural data. Due to the encoding of the csv file this is a little more complicated. So you can just run the code below. However, you have to adapt the file path!\n\n# You can find the data also here: https://www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/en/bundestagswahlen/2021/strukturdaten.html # you have to adapt the file path\nbtw17_structural &lt;- read_delim(\"C:/Users/David/Downloads/btw2017_strukturdaten.csv\", # you have to adapt the file path\n     delim = \";\",  # set semicolon as delimiter,\n     locale = locale(decimal_mark = \",\", # decimal mark used in the csv file is \",\" and not \".\"\n                     encoding = \"latin1\"), # set encoding due to Umlaute: ä,ö,ü and other special characters\n     escape_double = FALSE, \n     trim_ws = TRUE, \n     skip = 8) %&gt;%  # skip the first 9 rows \n  mutate(constituency_number = as.character(`Wahlkreis-Nr.`)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(constituency_number = sprintf(\"%03d\", as.numeric(constituency_number))) # e.g., this changes the constituency number from 1 to 001, 2 to 0002, etc. We need to to this transformation that we can merge the data frame with the 2017 election data\n\nNow, merge both data frames by constituency number, rename “Arbeitslosenquote März 2017 - insgesamt” to “unemployment_rate”, and create the “east” variable as above.\nNow we can plot our 2017 data! Try to create a scatterplot of unemployment rate and AfD vote share.\nNext, we highlight if the constituencies are in East or West Germany.\n\n\nCombine 2017 and 2021 data\nHere, we combine the data from 2017 and 2021. 1) We start by transforming the data frames separately: We want to focus on the following subset of variables: constituency_number, vote_share, unemployment_rate, east, 2) In addition, we create for each data frame a year variable using “tibble::add_column(year = XXXX)”, 3) we can use the function “bind_rows()” to combine both data frames.\n\n\nPlot using facets\nHere we want to plot our new data frame faceted by year:\n\n\nApply a custom theme\nHere, we load a Google font. You can select any font from here: https://fonts.google.com/.\n\nfont_add_google(\"Montserrat\", \"mont\")\n\n# or try: font_add_google(\"Fredericka the Great\", \"fredericka\")\n# \n\nThe function below activates the loaded fonts.\n\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\nNow, we create our custom theme. Use the theme from session05_example.Rmd!\nFinally, we only have to give informative labels to our plot and add our custom theme. That’s it!\n\n\nHints / Code\n\nLoad 2017 election data\n\n# You can find the data to download also here: https://www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/bundestagswahlen/2021/ergebnisse.html\nbtw17_kerg2 &lt;- read_delim(\"C:/Users/David/Downloads/btw17_kerg2.csv\", # you have to adapt the file path\n     delim = \";\",  # set semicolon as delimiter,\n     locale = locale(decimal_mark = \",\"), # decimal mark used in the csv file is \",\" and not \".\"\n     escape_double = FALSE, \n     trim_ws = TRUE, \n     skip = 9) # skip the first 9 rows\n\n\n\nTransform 2017 election data\n\nbtw17_election &lt;- btw17_kerg2 %&gt;% \n  # we want to get rid of all rows regarding the federal and regional level, and keep the constituency level.\n  filter(Gebietsart == \"Wahlkreis\") %&gt;% \n  # in additiom, we are interested in the \"Zweitstimme\"\n  filter(Stimme == 2) %&gt;% \n  # next, we are primarily interested in party name and the relative share.

They simply have to explain some phenomenon, and often the most obvious or commonsense explanation is the correct one. Don’t worry about trying to do something new that no one has done before. To be honest, most theory in political science is of the “well, yeah,” or “no, duh” level of brilliance: It’s an obvious, common sense answer to a question. But all theories, even commonsense ones, need to be stated and tested before we can accept them. Take a question that interests you, think about an answer, and go from there.\nPowner, 2015, p.22"

And why?\nFor example, comparative research on European politics:\n\nIt almost always makes little sense to compare systems before or during the 2. world war.

This is a problem if we want to know the “true” values for our observations.\nBut: For theory testing, we would still prefer biased but reliable measures compared to unbiased but unreliable measures. Why?\n\n\nWe look for the relationship between two variables: Even if our measure is biased upward, we would see the same association. E.g., higher values of X ➝ lower values of Y.\nCan you come up with an example?"
