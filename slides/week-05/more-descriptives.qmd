## The ESS

## Using ESS data for research

-   The ESS data allows us to conduct empirical research

-   We can study political phenomena

    -   at specific points in time or biannually over multiple years (2002 - 2020)

    -   in single countries or across multiple European countries and beyond (39 countries have participated at least once)

-   However, it is difficult to make causal claims as this is not a panel data set!

## Using ESS data for research

The ESS includes regular survey items (party affiliation, political interest, ...), and multiple rotating modules in each survey wave. For example:

-   Round 10: Democracy

-   Round 8: Climate change

-   Round 7: Immigration

## Understandings of democracy

-   Let us investigate how citizens across Europe view democracy using ESS Round 10.

-   First, we start by mapping views on democracy in Austria:

    -   **dfprtal:** How important you think it is for democracy in general... ...that different political parties offer clear alternatives to one another?

    -   **dfprtalc:** Please indicate to what extent you think each of the following statements applies in *\[Country\]*. Different political parties in *\[Country\]* offer clear alternatives to one another.

-   *Scales range from 0 -10; higher values indicate higher importance/agreement*

## Understandings of democracy in Austria

```{r, echo=TRUE}
load("ess_10_austria.rda")

# Let's inspect our dataframe
str(ess_10_austria)
```

## Understandings of democracy in Austria

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(ess_10_austria$dfprtal)

# Remove values: 77 (Refusal), 88 (Don't know), 99 (No answer)
ess_10_austria <- ess_10_austria %>% 
  filter(dfprtal <= 10) %>% 
  filter(dfprtalc <= 10)
```

## Understandings of democracy in Austria 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(ess_10_austria, aes(x = dfprtal)) +
         geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Understandings of democracy in Austria 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(ess_10_austria, aes(x = dfprtal)) +
         geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()
```
